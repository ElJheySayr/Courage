# Courage

“**Courage**” is a video game that primarily explores the mental phenomenon of impostor syndrome and its impact on individuals. The developers aim to convey what it feels like to experience impostor syndrome. While the portrayal is somewhat exaggerated, it is designed to enhance the player's experience.

The game is a single-player, first-person platformer puzzle game with a story-driven approach. It features five levels that help players understand impostor syndrome and how to overcome it.
